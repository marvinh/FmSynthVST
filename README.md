Frequency Modulation VSTi adapted from the examples:
IPlugPolySynth (https://github.com/olilarkin), and 
MDA-VST DX10 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/).

I implemented a vstgui, a voice allocation algorithm that 
will replace the oldest note if no other voices are available,
and a 4 operator fm matrix similar in style to that of Image-Line 
Sytrus or Native Instruments fm8.This project uses the vst 2.x sdk, 
and VSTGUI4 both found here http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
