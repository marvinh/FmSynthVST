# FmSynthVST

Frequency Modulation VSTi adapted from the examples:
IPlugPolySynth (https://github.com/olilarkin), and 
MDA-VST DX10 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/).

I added a vstgui, a voice allocation algorithm that will replace the oldest note
if no other voices are available,and a 4 operator sine wave fm matrix 
similar in style to that of Image-Line Sytrus or Native Instruments fm8.

This project uses only the vst 2.x sdk, and VSTGUI4.
both found here http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
